# Message Box Creator
![Image](/static/main_blank.png)  
A free and open-source tool to create your very own message boxes!

> **Note**: This program and the exported files work on Windows operating systems only.

## Installation
### 1.4.0.0 and older
The release of these versions is just a portable EXE file you can run!
### 1.5.0.0 and newer
You can run the EXE file included in the ZIP folder, however I strongly recommend to run the installation batch script for the best experience!

## Usage
### Getting started
When you use Message Box Creator for the first time or want to make a new configuration, click the **+** button to generate a message box. You can create up to 10 message boxes in a configuration.
### Entering data
To enter the data in the message box, click it in the list. Then, you can enter all it's values:
- The content of the message box;
- The title of the message box;
- The icon displayed in the message box (error, warning, question, information or none);
- The choices that can be made in the message box (OK, OK+Cancel, Yes+No, Yes+No+Cancel, Abort+Retry+Ignore, Retry+Cancel);
- Should it display always on top? If so, no icon can be displayed;
- Should it only show up when a specific choice has been made in the message box before?

When you want to save your current configuration before exporting it, click the **Save Configuration...** button. This way, you can save a configuration file ending on **.mbconfig** that can only be read by Message Box Creator.

### Loading a configuration
You can load a configuration by clicking the **Load Configuration...** button, or, in versions 1.5.0.0 and newer, if you installed Message Box Creator with the batch script, by launching it from File Explorer.
### Exporting a configuration
When finished, click the **Export** button. The message box configuration will be exported to a **.vbs** file.
